## 3. Introduction

### 3.1 Purpose
To architect a seamless, 'Flight 606' travel experience. This document details the technical infrastructure required to power a modern airline booking platform, focusing on real-time availability, modern web-design, and robust data integrity.

### 3.2 System Overview
The Airline Booking System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate flight searches, real-time flight selection, and passenger reservations. It emphasizes a premium user experience ("Flight 606") while maintaining a normalized data structure for flight manifests.

### 3.3 Scope
* **In-Scope:** Flight searching, flight selection UI, passenger data management, Admin Control & Record and booking confirmation.
* **Out-of-Scope:** Actual credit card or e-wallet processing (mock payments only), real-time radar tracking, and global distribution system (GDS) live sync.

### 3.4 Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **API Testing:** Postman
* **Design:** Figma
* **Project Management:** Trello

## 4. Overall Description

### 4.1 Product Perspective
The Airline Booking System is a **standalone web application** designed to provide a seamless, end-to-end flight reservation experience. While the current version operates as an independent platform for school project purposes, the architecture is designed to support future integrations with external Flight Data APIs and Global Distribution Systems (GDS).

### 4.2 Product Functions
* **Flight Search & Discovery:** Multi-criteria search (One-way, Round-trip, Multi-city) based on origin, destination, and travel dates.
* **Interactive Booking Engine:** A multi-step workflow including real-time seat selection via a cabin map and optional travel add-ons (baggage, meals).
* **User & Passenger Management:** Distinct handling of User Accounts (login/profile) and Passenger Manifests (legal travel documents) to support group bookings and guest checkouts.
* **Flight Status Tracking:** Real-time search functionality for users to check the arrival and departure status of specific flight numbers.
* **Administrative Dashboard:** A secure interface for staff to manage flight schedules, update seat availability, and export passenger manifests.

### 4.3 User Classes and Characteristics
* **Travelers (End Users):** Casual or frequent flyers who prioritize a high-clarity, intuitive interface. They require mobile responsiveness for booking and checking flight statuses on the go.
* **Flight Administrators:** Internal staff responsible for operational data. They require a "data-rich" dashboard to manage fleet capacity, pricing, and scheduling.
* **Guest Users:** Unauthenticated users who can browse destinations and search for flights but must provide passenger details to complete a transaction.

### 4.4 Operating Environment
* **Client-side:** Optimized for modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
* **Server-side:** Built on a Node.js runtime environment.
* **Database:** MongoDB as the primary data store for the Airline-booking system to leverage its document-oriented architecture. This allows for the seamless storage of multi-faceted booking data within a single record, reducing query latency compared to traditional relational joins. 

### 4.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
* **Connectivity:** It is assumed that users have a stable internet connection to access real-time flight data.
* **Data Source:** Flight schedules and pricing are assumed to be managed via the Admin Dashboard or a local mock JSON server for this iteration.
* **Mock Payment:** Payment processing is assumed to be handled via internal wallet system (purely internal logic). No real financial transactions occur
* **Mock Geolocation Logic:** For testing and demonstration purposes, the system utilizes a deterministic location-mapping logic rather than a live Browser API. The 'From' field is pre-populated based on a defined Test Profile (e.g., defaulting to 'MNL' for Manila) to ensure consistent UI behavior during the evaluation phase. Manual overrides remain available for all users.
* **Real-time pricing sync:** Stretch Goal and will only be implemented if the core features are completed first.

### 5.2 UI Logic Requirements
- **Hero & Navigation Logic**: 
  - **Sticky Header Transition**: As the user scrolls past the Hero image ($> 600px$), the navigation bar should transition from transparent to Rich Charcoal (#1F1F1F) with $90\%$ opacity to maintain legibility over content.
  - **Dynamic Tagline Carousel**: The text within the frosted glass box ("This view never gets old," "On cloud nine") should auto-rotate every $5$ seconds with a soft fade-in/out effect.
  - **Progress Slider**: The white progress bar below the tagline must sync with the carousel timer. Clicking the left/right arrows manually resets the timer to zero.

- **Smart Search Widget Logic**:  
    - **Trip Type Toggle**: Switching from "One way" to "Multi-city" must dynamically inject a new row of input fields (From/To) into the widget, expanding the golden container's height smoothly.
    - **Date Picker Constraint**: The "Departure Date" calendar must disable all dates prior to CurrentDate(). For "Round trip," the "Return Date" must disable all dates prior to the selected "Departure Date."
    - **Search Validation** The "Book now!" button remains disabled or returns an animation if the "From" and "To" fields are identical or if the date field is null.

- **Traveling From Your Location**:
  - **Mock Geolocation**: Instead of calling navigator.geolocation, the system executes a getMockLocation() function on initialization. This function retrieves a 'currentLocation' variable from a local configuration file. This ensures the 'From' input in the search widget is pre-populated instantly, matching the Design System's requirement for 'Traveling from your location' without latency or permission prompts.
  - **Real-time Pricing Sync(Stretch Goal)**: The price labels (e.g., $₱ 6,999$) should pull from a min_price variable in your Flights table. If a user changes their location, these cards should trigger a "shimmer" loading effect and refresh with new data.

- **Card Interaction & Animation**:
  - **Destination Card Hover**: On :hover, the destination image should scale by $1.05\times$ within its container (zoom effect) while the "Rich Charcoal" text on the right remains static. This provides tactile feedback without moving the text.
  - **View All / Explore More** Clicking "Explore more destinations" should trigger a smooth scroll or route change to a dedicated Catalog page with active category filters (e.g., "Beach," "City").
